# Generative-Adversarial-Networks-for-Anomaly-Detection-in-Biomedical-Imaging

Anomalydetection (AD) is a challenging problem in computer vision. Particularly in the field
 of medical imaging, AD poses even more challenges due to a number of reasons, including insufficient
 availability of ground truth (annotated) data. In recent years, AD models based on generative adversarial net
works (GANs) have made significant progress. However, their effectiveness in biomedical imaging remains
 underexplored. In this paper, we present an overview of using GANs for AD, as well as an investigation
 of state-of-the-art GAN-based AD methods for biomedical imaging and the challenges encountered in
 detail. We have also specifically investigated the advantages and limitations of AD methods on medical
 image datasets, conducting experiments using 3 AD methods on 7 medical imaging datasets from different
 modalities and organs/tissues. Given the highly different findings achieved across these experiments, we
 further analyzed the results from both data-centric and model-centric points of view. The results showed
 that none of the methods had a reliable performance for detecting abnormalities in medical images. Factors
 such as the number of training samples, the subtlety of the anomaly, and the dispersion of the anomaly in
 the images are among the phenomena that highly impact the performance of the AD models. The obtained
 results were highly variable (AUC: 0.475-0.991; Sensitivity: 0.17-0.98; Specificity: 0.14-0.97). In addition,
 we provide recommendations for the deployment of AD models in medical imaging and foresee important
 research directions.
